# Purpose --To delete tmp files.
# Ansible stores temporary information in /home/ansible/.ansible/tmp during playbook execution.
# These files should be deleted upon completion, but often remain and eventually fill-up the partition.
# 
# Place an include at the bottom of every playbook (H1 & H2) to delete tmp/*.
